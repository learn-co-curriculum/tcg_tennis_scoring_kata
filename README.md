# Tennis Refactoring Kata

## Learning Goals

- Use tests to refactor a ruby class

## Introduction

Clone the [Tennis Refactoring Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata). Follow the instructions in the Readme, using the ruby folder.

1. Run the tests with `ruby tennis_test.rb`
2. Refactor the three tennis game classes in `tennis.rb` one by one, using the tests to make sure the code still works at each step
3. Use the questions in the Readme to guide your reflection on the kata

## Bonus

Try the same refactoring exercise in Javascript (or another language!)
